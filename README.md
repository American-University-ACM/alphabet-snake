Alphabet Snake
==============

Web App for toddlers 

## Workflow with git for the newbies:

+ Make changes to a file named `<filename>` (example, obvy)
+ Save changes
+ In the terminal, make sure you are in the directory of the repo (`alphabet-snake`)
+ Do `git add <filename>`.  You may have to do the full path to the filename, like `git add js/main.js` for example
+ Think of an informative message, like `changed a bunch of stuff in main.js`, and do `git commit -m "changed a bunch of stuff in main.js"`
+ Last, do `git push origin master`.  If you don't see anything that says `error` or `abort` or another scary word, it probably worked!
